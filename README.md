# csqa - CLI String Operations

`csqa` is a fun CLI tool I built using Golang and Cobra to experiment with various string operations directly from the command line.

## Overview

`csqa` currently supports multiple string operations, such as:

- Reversing strings
- Changing case (uppercase, lowercase)
- Counting characters
- Replacing substrings

This tool was created as a learning exercise and is not intended for public use at this time.

## Installation

To use `csqa` locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csqa.git
